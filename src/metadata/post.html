                The goal of this prototyper is to be able to test out a rhythm, chord, or melody as quickly as possible.

            With a single scale, a single atomic unit of time, and a maximum of six entities to play indexed pitches
            from the scale in those atomic units of time, clearly this prototyper is not comprehensive, but it should do
            the trick for answering many types of questions.

            - <b>Rests</b> are represented by -1.
            <br>
            - <b>One beat</b> is the only duration available, though notes can be repeated.
            <br>
            - <b>Any numerical expression</b> is supported for the scale's scalars.
            <br>
            - <b>Different counts of notes</b> for the entities is supported, making polyrhythms possible.
