            This prototyper is designed to help test out a rhythm or melody as quickly as possible. It currently offers
            you a single scale and up to three entities to play indexed pitches from the scale. It currently offers only
            a single atomic unit of time so you'll have to get all your durations into common terms and perhaps decrease
            the base duration to offset.

            - Zeroes are rests.
            <br>
            - Notes cannot be sustained for longer than one beat, but can of course be repeated.
            <br>
            - Any numerical expression can be typed in for one of the scale's scalars.
            <br>
            - The three entities can each have different counts of notes, making polyrhythms together.

            Clearly the prototyper is not comprehensive, but designed with a certain type of idea in mind, a kind that I
            all-too-often have. I blame it on the all the Meshuggah.
